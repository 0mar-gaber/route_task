Task Description :

This project required creating a responsive design. The implementation followed the Clean Architecture pattern and utilized various tools and libraries including BLoC Cubit for state management, SVG icons, Dio for networking, and Dependency Injection (using Injectable and Get It). The Repository Pattern was also applied. While I planned to add pagination, I was constrained by time and the limitations of the provided API.
